# What this book is about

This book is about building a sample microservice application in Node.js that follows the [Twelve-Factor App methodology](http://12factor.net/) for

{linenos=on,lang="js"}
    var x = 1 * 3;
    
    console.log(x/10);d
    
    for(var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
      console.log(i);
    }

hahaha
